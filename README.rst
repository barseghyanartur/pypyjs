PyPy.  Compiled into JavaScript.  JIT-compiling to JavaScript at runtime.
Because why not.

This is a very-much-in-flux collection of supporting scripts and infrastructure
for an experimental emscripten/asmjs backend for PyPy.  You can read more about
the project (and try it out live!) here:

    http://pypyjs.org/

If you just want to use a pre-compiled PyPy.js interpreter, please download
a release bundle from the above website and follow the instructions in the
included `README <README.dist.rst>`_.

If you're like to work on the PyPy.js code itself, please see the details
in `CONTRIBUTING.rst <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.

For the history of the project, see `NEWS <NEWS.md>`_.
